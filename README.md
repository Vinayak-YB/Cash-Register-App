# Cash Register Application

This is a VanillaJS application which is a cash register app. It takes the bill amount and cash given as input and depending on the previous inputs it returns the number of notes for change to be given to the customer. The output is shown as number of cash denominations in the form of a table, check out the application and reach out to me for suggestions for improvement and comments.
